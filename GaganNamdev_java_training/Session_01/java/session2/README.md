### Java Training - Session 2 (Spring Boot Assignment)

## Overview

This project is developed as part of Session 2 of the Java training assignment.

It is a Spring Boot REST API application that demonstrates core backend concepts such as layered architecture, dependency injection, and component-based design.

The application follows clean coding practices with proper separation of concerns and uses in-memory data instead of a database.

---

## Architecture

The project follows a strict layered architecture:

Controller → Service → Repository
Controller → Service → Component

* **Controller** - Handles HTTP requests and responses
* **Service** - Contains business logic
* **Repository** - Manages in-memory data
* **Component** - Provides reusable helper logic

---

## Key Design Principles

* Constructor-based dependency injection is used
* No field or setter injection
* Business logic is only inside the Service layer
* Controller does not directly interact with Repository
* Clean separation of concerns

---

## Systems Implemented

### 1. User Management System

* Fetch all users
* Fetch user by ID
* Create new user
* Data is stored using in-memory list

---

### 2. Notification System

* API triggers a notification
* Message generation handled by NotificationComponent

---

### 3. Dynamic Message Formatter System

* Returns different messages based on type
* Uses:

  * ShortMessageFormatter
  * LongMessageFormatter
* Decision logic handled inside Service

---
